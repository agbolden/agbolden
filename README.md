# 👋 Hey, I’m Alexander Bolden

I'm a truck driver and cybersecurity professional, bringing discipline, precision, and a strong work ethic into the world of Vulnerability Management, GRC Compliance, and PCI-DSS auditing. I’m currently in a cybersecurity internship focused on vulnerability and control validation, and I’ve previously completed a PCI-DSS internship where I worked hands-on with audit prep, remediation, and compliance checklists.

Everything I build is anchored in real-world expectations, with a focus on solving problems, documenting processes, and delivering results.

## 🚧 Current Projects
